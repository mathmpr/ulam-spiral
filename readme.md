# About Ulam Spiral

The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.[1] It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.

# What is a prime number

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

# Challenge

The challenge itself was in building the spiral. Build the conditions to change the placement of each number on the spiral, and the right moment when the direction should change.

Combining this with the canvas, frame rate and number of objects to be shown in the 2d context of the canvas was also a challenge.
